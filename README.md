# Employee-Directory

## Overview

This app is an employee directory created with React. It allows a user to view all employees in a table, sort them by column or search for them by role. 

## User Story

* As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.

## Business Context

An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by role

## Acceptance Criteria

Given a table of random users, when the user loads the page, a table of employees renders. 

The user is able to:

  * Sort the table by all columns (both in ascending and descending order)

  * Filter the users by role
